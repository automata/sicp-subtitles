hi

2
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:18,544
you've seen the job of a programmer

3
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:22,619
is to design processes with couples of particular goals

4
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:25,694
satisfying to square two numbers

5
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:28,675
or other sort of things if we wanna do

6
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:30,877
we haven't introduced anything else yet heh :-)

7
00:00:31,127 --> 00:00:35,824
of course the way each programmers does this
is by constructing spels

8
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:39,574
which are constructed out of
procedures and expressions

9
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:43,324
and these spels are a

10
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:45,515
somehow directly processes

11
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:47,870
to accomplish the goal those are
atempted by the programmer

12
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:51,062
0

13
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,937
yes understanding the relationship

14
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,687
