Transcription (and translation) of the subtitles of the classical MIT lecture
classes about the book SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

The first english .srt is from 
http://sicp-subtitles.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/subtitles/en/srt/Lecture-1a.srt

My personal objective is to create pt-br translations of these subtitles.

Any help will be welcome!
